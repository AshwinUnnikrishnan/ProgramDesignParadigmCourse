1. Store the tickers in alphabetical or fetch should be fast.
2. Can we store tickers as hashmap instead of hashset.
3. Taking input remove redundant spaces at the last ( adversary or random user ).
4. Give option for user to go back if the userName existing is not present and then create a new account.
5. Check if the json is in valid state at any given point of time.
6. Testcases write more modularized strings.
    combining or giving combinations should be easier
7. Should not take stockName again when taking input from user.

Bugs:

    and other things. TODO : Feature for now that user wont be able to create a portfolio withou stocks

2. Not able to fetch stock price in evaluation print try again server busy.

Selling Stock
    List portfolio
        Get portfolio name
        print stocks in portfolio
            Get stock to sell
            Get the date to sell the stock on


3.
Create a new variable in portfolio that stores total money spent on that portfolio

4.
Determine the value of a portfolio on a specific date (to be exact, the end of that day).
The value for a portfolio before the date of its first purchase would be 0, since each stock in the
 portfolio now was purchased at a specific point in time.
